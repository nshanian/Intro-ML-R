# Introduction to Machine Learning in R

The workflow in this repository was adapted from a workshop given by Stanford University's Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Research [CIDR](https://cidr.stanford.edu/), part of Research Data Services within the Stanford Libraries. 

The R markdown files provide a gentle introduction to machine learning vocabulary and concepts. They cover the basics of ensemble machine learning practices using various R packages. `Intro_ML_R.Rmd` can be run as a single workflow or, for convenience, broken up into raw data pre-processing and final data analysis steps. To do this, run `ML_data_preprocess.Rmd` and save the output from steps 1 - 7 (ending in line 300), then wipe your global environment clean and run `SuperLearner.Rmd`. 

The reference data and image files are provided in thier respective subfolders.
